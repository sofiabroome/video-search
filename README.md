## Assignment description

"Your assignment will be to index around 1000 youtube clips which will be provided to you. You will have access to one or more video analysis api's which will do the hard machine learning part of converting video frames to textual keywords.

Your assignment:

* Categorize and index the 1k youtube clips
* Create a simple application (or web application) that lets a user search for a word and get an ordered list of videos back as a result.

This assignment can be expanded by trying out more ways of indexing videos. A wide selection of implementations/code of machine learning research papers dealing with multimedia can be found at GitXiv."
